            Hello! Iâ€™m Maha Devan, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with expertise in React.js, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and modern web technologies. I have a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development, enabling me to build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications.

I completed my B.Tech in Information Technology from Mookambikai College of Engineering, where I developed a keen interest in problem-solving, software architecture, and clean coding practices. My experience includes a Java Full-Stack Developer internship at Massmind, T. Nagar, Chennai, where I gained hands-on exposure to real-world applications and industry best practices.

I have worked on several personal and academic projects, including:

Hotel Booking Application â€“ A complete booking system using React, Java, and MySQL.
Weather Application â€“ A dynamic weather forecasting app using APIs.
To-Do Application â€“ A productivity tool built with React.js.
Touchless Gaming â€“ My UG project, integrating OpenCV hand tracking with Unity3D to create a touch-free gaming experience.
I am always eager to learn new technologies and keep up with the latest industry trends. My goal is to develop applications that enhance user experiences and solve real-world problems efficiently.

If youâ€™re looking for a dedicated and skilled developer to collaborate on exciting projects, feel free to reach out to me! ðŸš€
